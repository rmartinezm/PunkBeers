Punk Beers it's a simple android application that makes use of [PunkApi](https://punkapi.com/) as remote data source.
Punk Beers implements some of most popoular libraries and usefull concepts in the Android Dev's world. Let me list some ones:
* Kotlin (1.4.30) as programming languaje.
* Kotlin Coroutines (1.4.2).
* Modular Android app architecture.
* buildSrc directory for Dependencies and versions management.
* Koin (2.2.2) as service locator.
* Most popular Android Jetpack libraries (Databinding, Navigation, Room  and Paging).
* Retrofit as http client.
* MVVM + Clean Architecture (UseCase, Repository and DataSource Remote and Local)
